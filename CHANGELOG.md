# Changelog

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- **Multi-turn deep research report generation** — Phase 3 now generates reports section by section:
  1. Loads a report template defining the fixed section skeleton
  2. LLM generates a JSON outline with dynamic subsections under "核心发现"
  3. Each writing unit (section/subsection) is generated in a separate LLM call, allowing arbitrarily long reports beyond single-turn output limits
  4. References are accumulated per-section via `## New References` markers and automatically deduplicated and assembled into the final References section
  5. An optional expansion pass thickens thin sections when total length is below threshold

- **User-selectable report length** — Before starting research, the agent asks the user for desired report length (long/medium/short/custom) via `ask_user` with structured options buttons. Length preference controls number of research tracks and per-section detail.

- **Default report template** (`report_template.md`) — 7-section skeleton (执行摘要, 背景, 核心发现, 分析与启示, 局限性, 结论, 参考文献) bundled in the package. The template defines fixed top-level sections while allowing dynamic subsections under "核心发现".

### Improved

- **PDF report formatting** — Complete rewrite of `report_export.py`:
  - CJK font support: Noto Sans CJK SC (fallback to STSong-Light)
  - Improved layout: larger margins (20mm), better line spacing (leading=20), increased heading spacing
  - Proper heading hierarchy with bold section titles and visual separation

- **Settings persistence** — Settings loading and saving now uses deep copy to prevent mutation issues, with atomic writes for crash safety.

### Fixed

- **Report length question resume** — When the agent pauses to ask about report length, the `deep-research` command context is now preserved through the pending question metadata, ensuring the agent resumes with full deep research prompts and spawn policy.

- **CSS cache invalidation** — Static asset version bumped to force browser cache refresh.
